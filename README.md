# Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

A prototype machine learning project for detecting anomalies in network traffic.  
The goal is to explore how ML can be applied in cybersecurity, starting with a basic dataset and expanding to real-world scenarios.

## Features
- Train ML model to classify network traffic as normal or suspicious
- Evaluate accuracy using standard metrics
- Extendable to larger datasets and real-time traffic

## Getting Started
```bash
python intrusion_detection.py
